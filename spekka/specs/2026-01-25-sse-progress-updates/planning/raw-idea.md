# Raw Idea

## Issue Reference
#2 - progress doesn't update

## Description
maybe the socket isn't flushed? in firefox I don't see SSE

## Initial Observations
- Progress updates are not being received
- Potential socket flushing issue
- Firefox specifically not showing SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- This suggests a cross-browser compatibility or implementation issue with the SSE endpoint
