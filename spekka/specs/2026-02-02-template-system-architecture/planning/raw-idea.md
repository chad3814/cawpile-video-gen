# Raw Idea: Template System Architecture

## Feature Description

Design and implement a template abstraction layer that allows different video styles to be defined and selected at render time, enabling the same book data to generate videos with different visual themes, layouts, and animation styles. Each template should be able to be specified in JSON, and calls to `/render` or `/render-stream` can optionally include a JSON template.
